This Book Store project, constructed with the MERN stack, serves as a practical learning experience for me. It allows users to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations on books. Its primary aim is to grasp the fundamental concepts.

You can contribute by adding a book you've recently read or engaging in various CRUD functionalities. The project emphasizes simplicity to aid in understanding the core principles of web development using the MERN stack
